A user friendly bash script for Termux that automates the whole process of patching using Draco injector (a repo by mcbegamerxx954, available [here](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/draco-injector))

Made in 1 day with help from chatgpt  (for overall queries because I don't know bash very well) and [devendrn](https://github.com/devendrn) (helped fix an issue, credited him in code)
